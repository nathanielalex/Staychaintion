## ü§ñ AI Python Setup

**Installing Python in Ubuntu**
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
python3 --version   # Check Python version
pip3 --version      # Check Pip version
```
If the python and pip already installed then we are good to go

**Virtual Environment in Ubuntu**
```
cd ./staychaintion/ai-model
pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip list # to check all installed dependencies
```


## üí∏ AI Prediction Price
**Python & Notebook File Location**
```
cd staychaintion/ai-model/predictions/
```
**Created the AI Model**
<br>
The Model is already created by running the ‚Äútrain_model_final.py‚Äù
<br>
Simply just run that file to get the 3 .pkl file
```
python train_model_final.py
```
**Run the main_final.py python file**
<br>
Make sure you are in the same directory as where the main_final.py located
```
uvicorn main_final:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
That command will open the port to run the API and the frontend will fecth the API using Axios to get the response.
